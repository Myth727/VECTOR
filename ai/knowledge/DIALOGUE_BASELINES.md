# VECTOR — Dialogue Baselines Reference

**Universal knowledge seed for all AI models**
© 2026 Hudson & Perry Research 

This document defines what normal, healthy AI dialogue looks like in VECTOR terms.
It exists so any model analyzing VECTOR sessions can distinguish genuine drift from
natural conversation variation. Read this before interpreting coherence scores or signals.

## What VECTOR Measures

VECTOR scores every AI response using five components:

```
C = 0.25×TF-IDF + 0.25×(1−JSD) + 0.25×lenScore + 0.15×struct + 0.10×persist × repPenalty
```

**Critical:** This measures *consistency with recent context* — not quality, not correctness,
not intelligence. A response can be factually correct and score 0.40. A response can be
fluent and score 0.88. The score answers one question: *is the AI maintaining coherent
continuity with what came before?*

---

## Healthy Score Ranges by Conversation Type

| Conversation Type | Expected C Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Factual Q&A (stable domain) | 0.75 – 0.92 | High TF-IDF persistence, consistent length |
| Technical / engineering | 0.78 – 0.93 | Terminology repeats, structured responses |
| Creative / brainstorming | 0.55 – 0.78 | Topic shifts are expected and correct |
| Exploratory / philosophical | 0.60 – 0.82 | Legitimate vocabulary expansion |
| Multi-topic conversation | 0.55 – 0.75 | Score drops at transitions are normal |
| Long-form analysis | 0.70 – 0.88 | Scores stabilize as session establishes vocabulary |

**Kalman line (teal) is the reliable signal.** Raw scores bounce naturally.
Watch for multi-turn downward trends in the Kalman line, not individual low scores.

---

## Natural Score Variation — NOT Drift

These cause score drops that are correct behavior, not problems:

**Topic transitions**
User changes subject. Score drops 0.10–0.20 at transition turn. Normal. Kalman recovers
within 2–3 turns as new vocabulary establishes.

**Legitimate paraphrasing**
AI correctly rephrases prior content using different words. TF-IDF drops because exact terms
don't repeat. JSD may also drop. Score 0.50–0.65 is expected. Not drift.

**Length normalization**
First response in a new thread is often shorter or longer than the session average.
lenScore pulls C down. Stabilizes by turn 3.

**Domain vocabulary introduction**
AI introduces domain-specific terms not previously used. Vocabulary growth is high.
Looks like confabulation signal but is often correct. Check H-signal context.

**Appropriate brevity**
"Yes." "Correct." "See above." Score near 0.30–0.45. Not drift — the response is short
by design. Low entropy signal may fire. Check user intent before flagging.

## Score Interpretation Table

| Score | Meaning | Typical Cause |
|---|---|---|
| 0.88+ | Healthy, stable | Strong vocabulary persistence, on-task |
| 0.75–0.87 | Good | Normal variation, topic consistent |
| 0.65–0.74 | Acceptable | Some drift, monitor next 2 turns |
| 0.50–0.64 | Caution zone | Topic shift, length change, or early drift |
| 0.35–0.49 | Probable drift | AI went off-task, multiple questions, elaboration |
| 0.30–0.34 | Severe drift | Unrequested content, performance mode, context loss |
| < 0.30 (floor) | Maximum drift | Session integrity compromised |

## Variance States and What They Mean

```
CALM         σ² < 0.080    Stable session. AI on-task. Coherence locked.
NOMINAL      σ² 0.08–0.12  Normal operating range. No action needed.
CAUTION      σ² > 0.120    Variance rising. Watch next 2 turns.
DECOHERENCE  σ² > 0.200    High variance. Maximum correction fires automatically.
```

Variance measures *consistency of coherence* — not the score itself.
A session can have low scores but stable variance (consistently off-topic = predictable).
A session can have high scores but high variance (unpredictable swings = unreliable).

## What Causes Real Drift (vs Natural Variation)

**Real drift patterns:**

1. **Context loss** — AI stops referencing established session vocabulary. New terms appear
   without connection to prior turns. High vocabulary novelty + high variance simultaneously.

2. **Performance mode** — AI asks multiple questions instead of answering. Question flooding
   B-signal fires (4+ question marks). Score drops because response doesn't advance the topic.

3. **Sycophantic pivot** — AI changes its position to match perceived user preference.
   Sycophancy B-signal fires (2+ flattery patterns). Topic hijack may co-occur.

4. **Elaboration creep** — Responses grow 2.5× longer than session average without new content.
   Unsolicited elaboration B-signal fires. Length score pulls C down, variance rises.

5. **Confabulation onset** — High-confidence language appears alongside high variance.
   H-signal fires. AI is asserting things it cannot ground in session context.

## Normal B-Signal False Positive Rates

B-signals are proxy indicators. They fire on pattern matches, not confirmed behavior.
In normal friendly conversation expect these baseline false positive rates:

| Signal | FP Rate in Casual Conversation | FP Rate in Technical Conversation |
|---|---|---|
| Sycophancy | ~12% | ~3% |
| Hype inflation | ~8% | ~5% |
| Roleplay drift | ~2% | ~1% |
| Question flooding | ~6% | ~4% |
| Unsolicited elaboration | ~15% | ~8% |
| Topic hijack | ~5% | ~3% |

When a signal fires once in isolation: note it, don't act.
When two or more fire in the same turn: investigate.
When any signal fires 3+ times in a session: pattern confirmed, adjust harness.

---

## The FALSE+ Button

VECTOR's LOG modal has a FALSE+ button on every signal event.
Click it when a signal fired incorrectly. These corrections are exported in RESEARCH CSV
and used to improve signal calibration over time. This is the primary feedback mechanism
for improving detection accuracy.

## Coherence Score vs Response Quality

These are **not the same thing** and should never be treated as equivalent.

| Situation | C Score | Actual Quality |
|---|---|---|
| AI correctly changes topic | Low (0.45) | High |
| AI fluently repeats prior content | High (0.85) | Low |
| AI gives terse correct answer | Low (0.38) | High |
| AI gives long on-topic response | High (0.87) | High |
| AI confidently states wrong fact | High (0.82) | Low |

VECTOR detects *coherence drift* as a proxy for quality degradation.
It is not a ground truth quality measurement. H-signals and B-signals
are additional proxies, not confirmations.

**All outputs are proxy indicators. Honest framing is enforced throughout the codebase.**

## Research Basis

- **JSD for semantic drift:** Chuang et al. 2024 (DoLa, ICLR) — confirms Jensen-Shannon
  Divergence as correct tool for detecting semantic shift in LLM outputs. Bounded [0,1],
  symmetric, outperforms KL divergence on sparse vocabularies.

- **Sycophancy as systematic behavior:** Sharma et al. ICLR 2024 (Anthropic) — confirms
  sycophancy is a systematic RLHF artifact, not random noise. Present in all major RLHF-trained
  models. Pattern-based detection is a validated proxy approach.

- **GARCH for variance clustering:** Engle 1982, Bollerslev 1986 — GARCH(1,1) is the standard
  model for volatility clustering in time series. Applied here to coherence score variance.

- **Kalman filtering:** Standard signal processing. Applied to smooth noisy per-turn scores
  into a reliable trajectory estimate. κ=0.444 (Hudson Constant) is the fixed damping term.
